# Symptom Tracker

An Objective-C app that allows users with undiagnosed medical complications (especially gastrointestinal) to track and analyse their symptoms.
Allows users to easily input a symptom, as well as the food groups they ate immediately before experiencing the symptom, the
severity of the symptom on a scale of 1-10, the date and time of the symptom, and where the pain or discomfort was.
Users an easily view their symptoms categorized by either date, severity, or what hurt/bothered them. Users can also see an
analysis of their symptoms that shows what foods they most often ate before experiencing symptoms, and what time of day they
most frequently experienced symptoms. This analysis can be filtered by a range of dates or a range of severity, so that only certain symptoms
are included in the analysis.
